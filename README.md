# DET prediction by Machine Learning 

With the increase of experimental data in wastewater treatment, data-driven models are useful for modeling biological processes and complex mechanisms. However, few models have been developed for simulating anaerobic digestion and the biological processes which occur in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). In this study, a general data-driven modeling approach was developed to predict CH4 production from in-situ biogas upgrading in the biocathode MECs via direct electron transfer (DET) using artificial neural networks. A two-stage backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-NN) and nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model was developed to analyze the mechanisms of biogas upgrading. Experimental results demonstrated that the NARX-BP hybrid neural network predicted methane production via DET with a high regression coefficient (R2 = 0.91). In addition, this two-stage NARX-BP hybrid neural network architecture is generally available to support long-term prediction and optimal operation of not only anaerobic digestion but also more industrial systems.
